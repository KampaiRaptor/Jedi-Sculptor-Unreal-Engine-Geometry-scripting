# Jedi Sculptor

This project was mainly exploration in Geometry scripting. 
I end up making a small thing I call Jedi sculptor.

What would it look like if there was a jedi sculptor? Would he use lightsaber?

The system works with any static mesh. I hope to return to it once geometry scripting works a bit more practically in game.

//VR is there just coz it looks cooler, not required at all.
